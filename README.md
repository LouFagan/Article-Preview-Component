### What I learned

I learned how to make a triangle with css and position it under a component. I also learned a different way of setting up a project using gulp and sass. I deepened my learning about mixins and used the new @forward and @use to link all my scss.

### Continued development

I definitely want to continue learning javascript, SASS and all that has to do with front end development.
